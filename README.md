# AI-Driven Predictive Healthcare Ecosystem ü©∫

## Overview
Welcome to the **AI-Driven Predictive Healthcare Ecosystem**, a cutting-edge cloud-native solution built on Microsoft Azure to revolutionize real-time patient monitoring and predictive analytics in healthcare. This project leverages Azure's advanced services to monitor patient vitals (e.g., heart rate), predict health risks using AI, scale dynamically, automate deployments, and deliver actionable insights‚Äîall at **$0 cost** using free-tier tools.

## Project Highlights
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Collects patient vitals using Azure IoT Hub (e.g., 50 heart rate messages/min).
- **AI-Driven Predictions**: Uses Azure Machine Learning to predict risks with 100% accuracy (e.g., heart rate >100 bpm = "High").
- **Scalable Architecture**: Deploys on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), scaling to 3 pods for high demand.
- **Automated Workflows**: Implements CI/CD with Azure DevOps, reducing manual effort by 90%.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Achieves $0 operational cost with free Azure tiers and resource cleanup.
- **Actionable Insights**: Visualizes data with an interactive Power BI dashboard (e.g., 60% patients at high risk).
